{"easy": [{"question": "C++ is a superset of C.", "answer": "True", "explanation": "C++ is built upon the foundation of C and includes all of C's features and benefits. Therefore, C++ is considered a superset of C."}, {"question": "Bjarne Stroustrup invented C++ in 1979.", "answer": "True", "explanation": "Bjarne Stroustrup invented C++ in 1979 while working at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey."}, {"question": "Encapsulation is a programming mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.", "answer": "True", "explanation": "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that combines code and data into a self-contained unit called an object."}, {"question": "Polymorphism allows one interface to access a general class of actions.", "answer": "True", "explanation": "Polymorphism is the quality that allows one interface to access a general class of actions. It allows different objects to be treated as instances of a common class, enabling code reuse and flexibility."}], "medium": [{"question": "Inheritance is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object.", "answer": "True", "explanation": "Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects to acquire the properties and behaviors of other objects. It supports hierarchical classification and code reuse."}, {"question": "C++ was invented to handle the increasing complexity of programs.", "answer": "True", "explanation": "C++ was created in response to the need for better ways to manage the increasing complexity of programs. It provides features like object-oriented programming and data hiding to help programmers handle larger and more complex programs."}], "hard": [{"question": "C++ is a top-to-bottom programming approach, while C++ is a bottom-to-top programming approach.", "answer": "False", "explanation": "The statement is incorrect. C is a top-to-bottom programming approach, while C++ is an object-oriented programming approach. The terms \"top-to-bottom\" and \"bottom-to-top\" are not commonly used to describe the programming approaches of C and C++."}]}
